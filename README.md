# script-help
a small node utility that adds quickly shows the script commands available in a project

## How to make this work:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm run init` to make the cli script executable and add the `script-help` command to your path (via `npm link`).
3. Run `shelp` in any project that has a `package.json` file with a `scripts` object.
